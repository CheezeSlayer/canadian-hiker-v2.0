                    I’ve been to Chilliwack a couple of times, usually as a stopping point to buy whatever foodstuffs and 
                    necessities required for hitting the outback of Kamloops or Kelowna further east.  About a 2-hour drive 
                    from Vancouver over a roughly 100 km trip, Chilliwack is vastly different from Vancouver.  There are no 
                    towering skyscrapers, no complex sky train systems in Chilliwack that define the hilly terrain of the 
                    bustling metropolis that is Vancouver.  Chilliwack lies on a mostly flat piece of land with endless 
                    fields of farms and agriculture surrounding a network of suburbs.  Yet like Vancouver, Chilliwack offers 
                    no shortage of outdoor adventures in this area of the Lower Mainland.  Bordered by the Fraser River 
                    to the north and mountains to the south, Chilliwack possesses rich fishing and backpacking opportunities 
                    to folks all throughout the Lower Mainland.
                <br><br>
                    One of those opportunities can be found south east of the city, a region of woodland, mountains and 
                    lakes called Chilliwack Lake Provincial Park.  My first-time backpacking there can be defined as an 
                    exhausting and grueling ordeal that tested the limits of my endurance.  It can also be seen as a 
                    marvelous experience of fishing, sightseeing and relaxation.  Both cases hold true as in the end, I 
                    came out of that three-day trip with a deeper appreciation and respect of the glorious countryside 
                    right here in our own backyard.

                <p>
                    Jamie and I set out early August on the long weekend of BC day when the summer heat was at an all time high.  
                    Arriving at the Lindeman Lake parking lot just before 10 AM, we immediately set off to Lindeman Lake, the 
                    first out of three lakes that we planned to hit.  The lake itself was a short hike from the parking lot; we 
                    arrived at Lindeman within 45 minutes of hitting the trail.  Lindeman Lake’s small size in comparison to its 
                    neighbor, Chilliwack Lake is by no means a testament to its beauty.  Like many lakes around these parts, 
                    Lindeman waters give off a brilliant turquoise colour caused by erosions of the mountains surrounding it.  
                    Glaciers slowly break down rocks into a fine grain called rock flour.  This rock flour is carried along with 
                    the meltwater as temperatures warm and deposited into the lake resulting in this enchanting hue on a sunny day.  
                    We didn’t stay at Lindeman Lake for long and only gave enough pause to appreciate its beauty.  Being so close 
                    to the parking lot, it was not surprising to see that this lake attracts a lot of crowds.  All campsites were 
                    occupied so we moved on towards Greendrop Lake. 
                </p>

                                        We went along the left hand side of the lake, casting out every so often.  The lake waters are also glacial in 
                                        nature but only in a sunny day can the enchanting crystalline turquoise colours be seen.

                    While Greendrop Lake may look less impressive than Lindeman Lake (in my humble opinion), it’s greater proximity 
                    from the parking lot in comparison to Lindeman means that it generally receives fewer traffic and less people 
                    diving into its waters for a dip to escape the summer heat.  It’s no surprise that the fish in Greendrop Lake 
                    were bolder and less cautious which made for some decent fishing!
                </p>
                <h1 class="text-3xl my-2">Day 2 - August 4, 2019</h1>
                <p>
                    The next morning, we were off.  After a hearty breakfast of apple cinnamon oatmeal with some wild berries, we wasted 
                    no time in packing up the tent and making our way to the next destination.  Flora Lake.  It would be remiss of me to 
                    say that the trail from Greendrop Lake to Flora Lake didn’t push the limits of my endurance.  Within a few short hours, 
                    I had lost track of how many boulder fields we had to cross over a steady ascent under the sweltering heat of the hot 
                    summer sun; an ordeal exacerbated by the fact that I was also lugging around 14 cans of beer in addition to my camping gear.  
                <br><br>
                    Four excruciating hours later, we finally arrived at our destination.  Upon first laying eyes on the lake, I knew that 
                    it had all been worth it.  It’s a good thing that there isn’t an easy way to access Flora Lake.  Deterring all but the 
                    hardiest of folk, those who succeed in making the trek have phenomenal views of crystalline turquoise waters all to 
                    themselves.  Similar to Lindeman Lake in terms of general beauty, Flora Lake far outclasses Lindeman in terms of fishing 
                    and ruggedness.  Experiencing far less traffic and subsequently free from large crowds to take advantage of its glacial 
                    waters has resulted in a relatively undisturbed environment with waters much clearer and crystalline compared to Lindeman.  
                    The fish are expectedly more inquisitive, ready to chomp down bait and hook on the ready.  We caught several cutthroats 
                    and rainbows in rapid succession; it was an angler’s dream.

                <p>
                    On the third and final day, we left Flora Lake and began a slow steady ascent up the valley.  The weight of our backpacks was 
                    significantly lessened from drinking the last of our beers on the night before which made the hike significantly easier.  
                    In three short hours we finally got out of the valley and arrived at a junction by noon, on a slight depression surrounded by mountain 
                    ridgelines.  The area was flat and sparsely populated with trees.  Finding a shaded area away from the scorching sun, we were 
                    able to rest for a short while and get our bearings.  There were two trails that lay before us.  The north trail lead to 
                    Flora Peak which no doubt held amazing views of the surrounding area and beyond whereas the south trail leads back to the 
                    Lindeman parking lot.  We were tired, thirsty and the entire area felt like a sauna; the prospect of taking the south trail back 
                    towards home looked very enticing indeed.  We had also come so far in this journey; to skip going to Flora Peak now would leave 
                    us with feelings of regret for a long time.  Who knows when we will get another chance to visit this phenomenal area again?  
                    To make the going easier, we hid our backpacks away underneath some brush and trudged off to Flora Peak; the final ascent of 
                    our trip.  
                <br><br>
                    With no backpacks to weigh us down, we easily ascended Flora Peak in 45 minutes despite encountering many areas with loose rocks 
                    and steep inclines.  The views up there were nothing short of magnificent.  With an elevation of up to 1900 m, Flora Peak rewarded 
                    us with an uninterrupted 360-degree panorama of endless mountains extending down to Washington State as far as the eye can see.  
                    It is an enchanting experience; to be awed and humbled when looking out across an endless stretch of mountains, seemingly 
                    unfettered by the touch of industry.  Views like this that make it all worth it in the end, it is the price we all pay with pain 
                    and sweat for moments that can never be found inside the suburbs or cities down below.

                    With the final goal of our journey met, we began our descent down the mountains.  An ordeal which took about 3.5 hours, I finally began 
                    to feel the ache in my knees during that period.  For the last three days, we had hiked a rough total of 18 km with the heat of the 
                    summer sun bearing down at our backs.  By the time we arrived at Lindeman Parking lot, I was ready to collapse.  Hitting the three lakes 
                    at Chilliwack Lake Provisional Park was probably the most fun I’ve had yet with the perfect balance of hiking and fishing.  Yet it was 
                    also probably on of the most physically challenging of experiences ever.  With that being said, I wouldn’t change a thing about this trip 
                    if I could start over from the beginning.  The ache on my knees, the blood, sweat and tears we went through are all testament to how 
                    nothing in life is free and effort must be made in order to enjoy its pleasures.

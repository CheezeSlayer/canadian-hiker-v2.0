                    The North Shore Mountains has always been a marvel of beauty.  
                    During my lunch breaks I would frequent the waterfront of Coal Harbour 
                    and gaze upon the humbling majesty of those rocky giants overlooking Greater Vancouver; 
                    an experience surpassed only by exploring every trail, summit,
                    nook and cranny that these mountains offered to folks of adventurous spirit.  
                    For within the glorious outback hides a sprawl of trails old and new, leading to treasures of 
                    lakes, creeks, waterfalls, and peaks of unparalleled beauty.  A sanctuary diverse in various 
                    forms fish, birds, animals, insects and plants alike, secluded away from the noise and fumes of the city.

                    One of these trails is the Howe Sound Crest Trail.  Boasting a length of roughly 29 km, 
                    this trail stretches northwards from Cypress Bowl to Porteau Cove along the Sea-to-Sky 
                    Highway and passes through various notable landmarks such as the iconic Lions and Brunswick Mountain, 
                    the highest of the North Shore Mountains.  Just a little due south of the Porteau Cove trailhead is 
                    Deeks Lake, the site of my first backpacking trip ever in British Columbia's glorious outback.  
                <br><br>
                    I set off early morning with my fellow friends and adventurers Jamie and Derek on September 2, 2018 the start of 
                    the Labour Day long weekend and arrived at the Porteau Cove trailhead sometime around 9 AM.  
                    By then the sun was already shining up high giving off a warmth that would soon boil into a 
                    sweltering heat as the day went on.  Our cohort headed south following the Deeks Creek Trail; 
                    a gradual uphill for about 2 hours.  The path eventually came across a turnoff marked by a sign connecting eastwards to the 
                    Howe Sound Crest Trail (HSCT). The path became significantly steeper on the HSCT with a lot of loose 
                    rocks which impeded our progress, in an ordeal that was exacerbated by our heavy backpacks and equipment.  
                    Despite the grueling trial, we encountered various viewpoints for a worthwhile stop and breather 
                    offering magnificent views of the Howe Sound.  It would be another 3 hours before we finally reached the banks of Deeks Lake.

                    The lake itself is a small but charming area; a view that is nothing short of magnificent surrounded by mountains and tall trees of pine and evergreen, 
                    some of which had long since fallen and their dry sunbaked trunks lay floating along the banks forming 
                    a natural pier of sorts.  By now it was roughly 1 PM and the sun at its zenith.  Its rays shining bright upon the 
                    lake's glistening surface emitting dancing sparkles of light, completing the enchanting scenery of the area.  Drenched 
                    in sweat, we threw off our heavy packs and proceeded along the pier of logs to dip our weary feet into its refreshing cold.    
                <br><br>
                    No time was wasted in finding and setting up a campsite.  Having brought fishing rods, we were eager to head back down 
                    and get some fishing done.  Deeks Lake contains a healthy number of cutthroat trout; closely related to rainbow trout, 
                    cutthroats are distinct for a red and orange colouration on their gill plates and lower jaw.  Depending on their habitat 
                    and subspecies, mature cutthroats can grow up to 40 inches long.  However, the largest ones seen at Deeks Lake were only 
                    about 8 to 14 inches which all things considered is still pretty sizable given that it is a small lake.

                    There is a wonderful feeling that I can’t really put into words or find anywhere else outside of fishing.  
                    Beginning with that initial tug of the line from a curious nibble to a hard pull as a fish sinks down on 
                    your bait evokes a sensation of tense excitement every time, followed by a joyous shout of “I got one!” 
                    and reeling it in as the hook is set.  It not only is a unique experience, but it certainly does make my 
                    buddies and I greatly appreciate the glorious bounty offered by nature right in our backyard.  The fish 
                    bit hard that day and we caught plenty.  Most were no more than 10 to 12 inches, but it felt amazing every 
                    time to reel them in and let them go. 
                <br><br>
                    A fishing trip wouldn’t be complete without a catch and cook.   Trout in general is delicious and cooking 
                    them isn’t hard at all.  I won’t go into detail on how we gutted and prepped it for the frying pan but eventually, 
                    I may plan on making a separate post on how I go about the process.  Frying it up with a little bit of oil, 
                    drizzle of lemon juice with a side of onion led to mouthwatering results.   Man, it doesn’t get any fresher than this.  
                <br><br>
                    As bright as the sun was during the day, the moon glowed powerfully with vibrant brilliance at night.  
                    I remember being woken up to by Jamie and left the tent to a dazzling display of the night sky filled with stars; 
                    a view that simply could not be witnessed back in the city or the suburbs.  It’s times like this that I wish 
                    I was not limited to the camera on my phone but had an actual DSLR capable of taking nighttime long exposure shots.  
                    Experiences like often get me thinking that at one point in time, most people were living like this without phones, 
                    cameras, or any modern condiments to survive on.  In a way it certainly makes me appreciate the great outback 
                    even more, for in all the bounties it can offer, the North Shore Mountains can easily be a harsh and unforgiving place.
